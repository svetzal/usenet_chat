## Technology Foundation

- use clean, modular, and modern async python code, with a pep 621 compliant pyproject.toml
- have a rich command-line experience (use Rich, Typer libraries for good CLI experience and code modularity)
- characterize usenet / nntp server behaviours in order to provide a comprehensive test suite

## Running Commands

You have access to all python and pip and project commands from the .venv virtual environment folder.
Make sure you `source .venv/bin/activate` before running any python or project commands

## Project Structure & Development Pattern

When maintaining TODO.md, follow this structure pattern:

### 1. Implementation Details (Top Section)
- **Phase N: [Feature Name]** - Technical implementation details
- Task lists with [x] completed and [ ] pending items
- Success criteria for each phase

### 2. Success Showcase (Middle Section)
- **Completed Use Cases** - Real command examples with actual results
- **Advanced Features Working** - Technical achievements and UX enhancements
- Proven functionality with specific examples and performance metrics

### 3. Future Planning (Bottom Section)
- **Future Considerations** - Upcoming phases and development roadmap
- Keep this section focused on what's next, not what's done

This pattern ensures the document tells a complete story: what was built, how it works, and what's planned next.
